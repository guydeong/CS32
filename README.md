# CS32 - UCLA, Spring Quarter 2023
This Repository contains my homework/project solutions for CS32 (Object-Oritented Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms) with Professor Smallberg, Spring 2023. In this course, I learned how to use a variety of data structures, including linked lists, stacks and queues, trees, hash tables, heaps, and graphs. Furthermore, the course explored more computer science topics such as inheritance and polymorphism, recursion, templates, STL, and Sorting algorithms. This course consisted of 5 Homework Assignments and 4 Project Assignments
